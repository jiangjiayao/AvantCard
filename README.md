# AvantCard


For Jason

- [ ] Why dont give decline page when declined, why rather say '24 hrs...'
- [ ] When asking for phone numbers, which type do we prefer? Can we put 'mobile' as default?
- [x] cards.avant.com not working? avant.com/card --> note: only for account management
- [ ] When setting up auto-pay, option to save bank info?
